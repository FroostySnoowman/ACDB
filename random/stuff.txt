I currently have a class that needs a database connection. It requires `await`, how could I connect to my database outside the class' `async def` so I can use it with defining things such as the `label`?

Connection: 
```py
db = await aiosqlite.connect('database.db')```

Class: 
```py
class TicketSystem(discord.ui.View):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(timeout=None)

    @discord.ui.button(label='Support', style=discord.ButtonStyle.green, custom_id='tickets:1')
    async def tickets(self, interaction: discord.Interaction, button: discord.ui.Button):```
